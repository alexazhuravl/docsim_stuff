7713,1445,SpillNot,"<p>The SpillNot is a cup holder with a difference. Its design means that it is difficult&nbsp;to spill the contents of any glass or mug that is placed on it. You can swing the SpillNot as much as you like and the drink stays in the mug! This is particularly useful&nbsp;for carrying hot drinks, which&nbsp;you cannot place in your lap.</p>

<p>The SpillNot can be used for carrying mugs, glasses and small bowls. The non-slip coaster (included) can be removed and used to protect furniture; it also works as a jar opener.</p>

<p>The SpillNot has a curved plastic body with a non-slip platform for cups or glasses, and a fabric handle that you can slip your hand into.&nbsp;The looped, fabric handle prevents you from applying a lateral force to the liquid in the cup, so the liquid doesn&rsquo;t spill (the science is quite complicated!).</p>",""
